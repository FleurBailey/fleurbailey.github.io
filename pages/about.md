Throughout my childhood my parents encouraged me to be inspired by the creative industries; through going to galleries at a young age to actively creating art. The impact of this is that art is know a huge influence on my day-to-day life, I feel it important to immerse yourself in new cultures and to embrace new forms of art.

Over the last few years I have made an active choice to visit galleries across the UK, as well as being fortunate enough to visit several in Europe. Currently, I am living as a student in Oxford; I am constantly surrounded by historical architecture which personally makes this city a truly inspiring place to study.

Throughout this blog, I shall be sharing my experiences at recent exhibitions and also my favourite galleries at home and away.
