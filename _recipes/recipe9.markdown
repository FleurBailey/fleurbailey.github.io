## Ingredients

_Stewed Black Beans_
- &#188;	 cup (½ stick) unsalted butter
- 1 yellow or red bell pepper (or half of each), seeded, finely chopped
- 1 small red onion, finely chopped
- 1 jalapeño, seeded, finely chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, sliced
- 2 15.5-ounce cans black beans, rinsed, drained
- 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth or water
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped cilantro
- Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper

_Assembly_
- Vegetable oil (for frying; about ½ cup)
- 2 corn tortillas
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided
- 6 large egg whites
- Kosher salt
- &#188;	cup sour cream
- 1 cup shredded iceberg lettuce
- Hot sauce (for drizzling)
- 1 &#189;	ounces shredded ricotta salata (about ⅓ cup)
- &#189;	avocado, sliced
- &#188;	cup cilantro leaves with tender stems

## Method

_Stewed Black Beans_
1. Heat butter in a large pot over medium. Add bell pepper, onion, jalapeño, and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are very soft, 10–12 minutes. Add beans and chicken broth.
2. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid is reduced by half and thickened, 20–25 minutes. Stir in cilantro; season with salt and pepper. Keep warm.

_Assembly_
1. Pour oil into a small skillet to come ¼" up the sides. Heat over medium-high until very hot. Working one at a time, fry tortillas until lightly browned and very crisp, about 1 minute per side. Transfer to paper towels to drain.
2. Melt 1 Tbsp. butter in a small nonstick skillet over medium heat. When butter begins to foam, add 3 egg whites and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula and forming a compact bundle, until whites are set but still moist, about 1 minute. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining 1 Tbsp. butter and 3 egg whites.
3. Divide sour cream between tortillas. Top with ½ cup bean mixture, followed by lettuce, egg whites, a drizzle of hot sauce, cheese, avocado, and cilantro
