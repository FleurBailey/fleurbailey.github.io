# Avocado Ice Cream

Avocado is a fruit, and it gives this silky treat a wonderful colour and gorgeous texture, thanks to its fat content. Feel free to add nuts, chocolate or spices

## Ingredients

- 2 vanilla pods
- 200 g sugar
- 1 lemon
- 1 lime
- 4 ripe avocados
- 500 ml whole milk

## Method

1. Halve the vanilla pods lengthways, scrape out the seeds, then add to a saucepan with the pods. Add the sugar, and the zest and juice from your lemon and lime.
2. Bring to the boil, then simmer for a couple of minutes until all the sugar dissolves.
3. Take off the heat, pour into a bowl and leave to cool. Don’t put your finger in for a taste, though, as it could burn you.
4. Once the syrup is cool, remove the vanilla pods.
5. Peel, destone and scoop the avocado flesh into a liquidiser with the syrup and milk. Blitz to a smooth, light consistency – like a smoothie.
6. If you’ve got an ice-cream maker, put your mixture into it and churn till smooth and frozen. If not, pour it into a large baking dish or deep tray and pop it in the freezer, giving it a whisk every half hour or so until frozen and smooth.
7. You can eat it right away or transfer it to little containers, cover and pop in the freezer for later.
