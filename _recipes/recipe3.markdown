# Chocolate, Peanut Butter and Avocado Pudding

Avocado's neutral flavour and creamy texture makes it a wonderful substitute for dairy in desserts or smoothies. These little pots will keep for a few days in the fridge - a great make-ahead dessert!

## Ingredients

- 2 large, ripe avocados, halved and stoned
- 1 large banana, chopped
- 5 soft prunes
- 6 tbsp unsweetened almond milk or coconut milk
- 2 tbsp smooth peanut butter
- 3 tbsp cacao powder (or good quality cocoa powder)
- 100g coconut milk yogurt
- 2 tsp maple syrup or honey
- dark chocolate to decorate


## Method

1. Scoop the avocado flesh into a food processor.
2. Add the chopped banana, prunes, almond or coconut milk, smooth peanut
   butter and cacao powder.
3. Blend until smooth, adding a little more milk if the blade gets
   stuck. Scrape down the sides once or twice and blend again.
4. Divide the mixture between 4 small glasses. Mix the coconut
   yogurt with the maple syrup or honey and top each pudding with a generous dollop.
5. Finely grate a little dark chocolate over the top and chill for at
   least 1 hr.
