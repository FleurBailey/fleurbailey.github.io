At university and home many of my friends have followed creative routes, sobeit through university or the casual hobbyist. I love being surrounded by people that inspire me every day through their work. During lockdown I wanted to catch up with some of them to see how Corona virus has impacted their work as well as creative industry as a whole. I spoke to a student photographer (SP), a freelance graphic designer (GD) and a painter (P).

### 1.	Can you tell me a little bit about yourself?
>  **SP:** I’m a third-year student studying Photography. I’ve always been interested in the arts from an early age but particularly interested in the art of photography. I enjoy having the ability to capture moments and use them to portray a certain time. Personally, I love shooting on film, I think the quality and the pictures you can gain from this just transform your work completely.

>**(GD):** I am a freelance graphic designer, and I have been working for about two years. I love the freedom that comes with graphic design, you can be working on one project that is totally different from the next. This set-up really works for me and I really appreciate that I’m able to work as a freelancer.

>**(P):** By career I’m actually working in marketing, but my main love is painting, I hope to one day make it my career but at the moment it is just a hobby. I set up an Instagram where I share my work and it has really helped to boost my confidence about the future of maybe becoming a freelance artist.

### 2.	Did you go to university?

>**(SP):** I do, well did! I’m currently in my final year, I’m wrapping up my final major project (FMP) for my Photography degree as we speak.

>**(GD):**  I did, but I didn’t study Graphics! I actually studied English Language but started learning Graphic Design whilst at university. I actually self-taught myself using YouTube and asking my friends who were and still are pros at it! What really boosted my confidence was that my friend who help taught me asked me to help him on a project where he had been asked to produce content to help promote events at a nightclub in our university town.   

>**(P):** I didn’t! University never really appealed to me, I studied Art all throughout school and college and have just maintained my love of it outside of an academic setting. I think there is a pressure these days to go to university, so I was a bit scared not to go but I’m happy I stuck it out.

### 3.	What was your main influence for studying an art related subject?

>**(SP):** Studying something I was interested in was really important to me as I knew I wouldn’t be particularly motivated to do it otherwise. A big influence on choosing Photography was actually my college teacher who really encouraged me to carry on with my study of the subject and I’m so grateful she did.

### 4.	How has lockdown impacted you creatively?

>**(SP):** As I’m still at university I’m now completing my final year remotely from home. I won’t lie, I was gutted to have my time cut short but I’m trying to see the positives and use this time at home to finalise my FMP. I’m trying to capture these lockdown moments, I cycled into the city centre the other day and it was like a ghost town. You rarely see it, I’m so glad I took my camera down with me. I’m trying to use this time productively you could say.

>**(GD):** I’ve had a few projects cancelled or postponed but for the most part it’s okay at the moment. As I’m freelancer I’m quite used to working from home so in that aspect it’s okay. I’m trying to use this time to slow down and take some time to recharge and find some new inspiration. I think in today’s society it is easy to get wrapped up in a go-go-go mentality so I’m enjoying taking some time to complete some personal graphic design projects.  

>**(P):** Before lockdown I was spending what felt like hours commuting everyday so I’m using this spare time to paint more which I’m loving. I’m missing office life but trying to make the most of this time. I’m also trying to boost my art Instagram which before I didn’t have the time to do.
