When purchasing a ticket at the Tate Modern to see the Olafur Eliasson I was asked, I was if I was a member of Tate Collective to which I wasn’t so I signed up. I have not thought about Tate Collective since then, however, inspired by looking into Yayoi Kusama, I thought I would use my lockdown time to look into the Tate Collective and see what it could offer during quarantine days. In doing this, I have realised how much and varied content that Tate Collective provides!

# What is it?!

Launched in 2018, Tate launched a new membership scheme with the aim of encouraging more young people to visit the four Tate galleries. It’s free to join and it has so many benefits including access to exhibitions for only a fiver, which when you think about it is so cheap especially for exhibitions in London. Former Tate Director, Maria Balshaw, stated:

> _“We are acting on what 16 to 25-year-olds say they want so that we can make the changes needed for future generations. Our sector should be shaped by their creative energy and their message to us is clear: arts institutions should plan ‘with’ not ‘for’ them.”_


I wanted to know why she featured dots in so many of her works so explored this idea further, and I must admit I was incredibly shocked when I found out the answer.

# Why dots?!

When Yayoi Kusama was younger, she said she had a hallucination that left a mark on her. The hallucination was that was in a field of flowers, and they started talking to her (particularly already), and the heads of the flowers looked like dots. For as far as she could see there were dots, giving her the feeling that she was disappearing into these dots; with Kusama describing it as ‘self-obliterating’ into a field full of dots. This bizarre experience influenced much of her later work. The artist stated that by adding these now famous dots all over her work, it makes them melt into and become part of the bigger universe.

> _Our earth is only one polka dot among a million stars in the cosmos. Polka dots are a way to infinity. When we obliterate nature and our bodies with polka dots, we become part of the unity of our environment_

So; you’re intrigued now. You wanna know what self-obliterating feels like, well lucky for you Kusama creates installations full of dots so that you can experience the feeling of self-obliteration.

Yayoi Kusama calls them the ‘Infinity Rooms’ (which are coming to the Tate post lockdown!). They’re created by adding hundreds of flashing lights to a mirrored room. The effect being that the lights are reflecting endlessly around mirrored room, making it appear that you are surrounded and immersed by the dots. For obvious reasons it can’t see this in real life at the moment, but I’d highly recommend you look at the videos of these rooms on [YouTube][81bcd55b] look incredible!

I for one am so excited to be able to experience Yayoi Kusama’s art installations in real life post lockdown and now I know a little more about the meaning behind them it will make it even more of an interesting experience.
