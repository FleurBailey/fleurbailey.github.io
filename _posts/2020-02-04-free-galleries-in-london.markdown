In the twenty-six years since the first blog was created the world of blogging has dramatically evolved. In present-day it is predicted that is over 500 million blogs active on the internet; with this equating to nearly a third of all websites active online.

In recent years, there has been a rise in the development of food bloggers. These food bloggers have developed into notable brands and have an incredibly large following. This great following has allowed for these once hobbyist food bloggers to create multi-million-pound brands, extending to the creation of cookbooks and even cookery shows. This vast network of food bloggers is not just influencing the consumers' lives but hand in hand is also impacting the industry itself with the creation of food trends that restaurants then tried and copied; a good example of this is the rainbow bagel, which was then seen all across social media. Many food outlets now try and make food that can be seen as 'Instagram worthy' and will be attractive to food bloggers. In doing so, it would encourage food bloggers to visit the restaurants and share their experience with their readers, which as a result would lead to advertising for the food outlets. A company that used this to their advantage is the London based cafe, Cereal Killer Cafe. It could be argued that they amassed their large customer base due to many bloggers sharing about their quirky dining experience online, so-be-it through their blogs but also on their social media accounts such as the previously stated Instagram.

But what is the impact of food bloggers? The influence that comes hand in hand with food blogging is immense. 84% of consumers purchase after reading about a product or service on a blog. The economic benefit of bloggers is quickly being noticed and many advertisers now work with bloggers to promote their products and to gain from the impact of the influencer.

Not only has it adjusted the way in which we are being targeted by advertisers but it has also impacted how consumers now hunt for inspiration when it comes to dinners. Rather than hitting the bookstore to purchase a new cookery book for inspiration, 89% of consumers are now going online to find new recipes with a further 55% of consumers going to blogs frequently to gain inspiration. Food bloggers have four times as many followers than any other industry with an average of 23,742 monthly unique visitors.

As well as impacting our virtual life, food bloggers are effectively impacting the food trends that are influencing global food companies. Top trends among recipes and food bloggers then affected how supermarkets marketed their food an effort to capitalise on the effect that food bloggers have on consumers.
Top trends of the past years were:
1. Using healthier substitutes
- Seen via the rise in availability of products such as cauliflower rice
2. Vegan diets
- Seen via the rise of mainstream supermarkets creating a more diverse and extensive vegan product range
3. Eating sustainably
- Seen in supermarkets of the rise of advertising which fruits and vegetables were in the season which results in less CO2 emissions

These examples clearly highlight show that the impact of food blogging goes deeper than just the social act of sharing food. Sharing food has always been a key part of society and now with the influence of food bloggers it has just made this act larger and more accessible. Not only are consumers benefiting from blogging, but advertisers and supermarkets are also just two of the large group that are successfully utilising the benefits that come from having an extensive and loyal following that food bloggers have.
