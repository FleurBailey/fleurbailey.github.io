In the twenty years since May 2000, Tate Modern has welcomed over 100 million visitors through their doors. To celebrate the anniversary of its opening they will dedicate a day to special displays and performances across the modern art gallery. 

Director of the Tate Modern, Frances Morris states that:

_Our plans for May 2020 encapsulate the best of Tate Modern. We will shine a spotlight on some of the newest artists to join our collection, go behind-the-scenes in our conservation studio, and run talks and tours across the building. We also want to highlight some of the artists Tate Modern has championed over the past 20 years: Kusama and Bourgeois, for example, not only represent our commitment to great artists with truly international careers, but they also embody art’s journey from the avant-gardes of the early 20th century to the immersive installations being created today._

To mark the anniversary, Tate Modern will be hosting a year-long exhibition that will showcase the work completed by celebrated contemporary artist Yayoi Kusama. The exhibition will allow visitors to experience two of the artist's most famous immersive mirrored room installations. _Infinity Mirrored Room – Filled with the Brilliance of Life_, which is one of Kusama's largest exhibitions will be shown at the Tate Modern along with _Chandelier of Grief_.

Other notable art pieces that will be returning to the Turbine Hall is the _Maman_ by Louise Bourgeois, which was the first installation that greeted visitors back in 2000 when the gallery was opened.

As part of Tate's ongoing support of performance art, they will feature several performances including _Balance of Power_ from Allora and Calzadilla which includes three yoga practitioners performing an array of warrior yoga poses wearing military uniforms.

The twentieth celebrations are bound to be an eclectic mixture with something for everyone. It is exciting to see the new and old merge together for one celebration.
