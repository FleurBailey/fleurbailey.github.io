London is expensive, it’s no secret, so in order to keep living or travel costs low it’s nice to have some free galleries to visit to further your art and culture knowledge of the city!

1. The Victoria & Albert Museum – Kensington
- Home of highlights of British history from 1500 through to 1900, the gallery is arranged in a format that lets you trace the history in a chronologic order.
- The art type there is so varied that there is really something for everyone.

2. National Gallery – Trafalgar Square
- Founded in 1824 to house just 36 pieces of work, it’s now home to over 2,000 with work from the likes of Raphel and Giotto, it’s the perfect place to admire work from the greats of the art world

3. Tate Modern – Bankside
- Within the Tate Modern there are so many different galleries featuring all types of Modern Art, which is one of the reasons as to why it is one of my favourite galleries in London
- Four years ago they opened the extension that allows for 60% more gallery space
- It also now has a viewing deck which allows for 360 degree views across London

4. God's Own Junkyard - Wathamstowe
- This gallery is holds a quirky selection of neon signs
- Famous for its Vogue photoshoot as well as being one of the most Instagram worthy galleries in London

5. The Design Museum - Kensington
