Last summer I was fortunate enough to get tickets to the highly acclaimed Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams exhibition at the V&A Museum. It is the largest and most widespread Dior exhibition that the UK has ever hosted. Following the history from 1947 to present day, it explores the influence and impression all of the artistic directors have had since Christian Dior passed away in 1957.

The exhibition showcased over two-hundred rare haute couture garments designed and made by the team at Christion Dior. Alongside the beautiful outfits they had the original illustrations which meant you could follow the design process, it highlighted the amount of talent behind each and every one of the team.  

Each section of the exhibition has a different element that they are celebrating. The theatrics behind it all and the high level of production was immense. You can really see the vast amount of time and effort that has gone into completing this exhibition to an extremely high standard.

My personal favourite part of the display has got to be ‘The Ballroom’ which houses absolutely beautiful formal evening wear, including some that had been worn by notable figures to events such as the Academy Film Awards. What made this room so special to me was the light installation and synergy with the music, it made the exhibition feel incredibly immersive.
